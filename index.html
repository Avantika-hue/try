<p>Oceans are slowly becoming human dust-bins. Garbage in the ocean comes from trash from trash cans, the streets, and landfills that gets blown into sewers, rivers, or directly into the ocean. The trash makes its way into storm drains. Trash travels through sewer pipes, into waterways, and finally into the ocean. <br><br>is not visible to any one </p>
<h2>Sunset</h2>
<p>When the sun is setting, its light must travel through the thickest part of the atmosphere. This causes more scattering to occur. As a result, longer wavelengths are reflected (red, orange, and yellow), creating beautiful colours in the sky.</p>
